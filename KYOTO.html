					Kiyomizu-dera Temple is a temple located in Kiyomizu, Higashiyama District, Kyoto City, Kyoto
					Prefecture, Japan, founded by the people of Nobu around 778 (the 9th year of the Takarame).
					Kiyomizu-dera Temple's mountain name is Otowa Mountain, which is mainly dedicated to the Senju
					Kannon, and originally belonged to the sect of the Hosang-zong, but is now independent and has
					become the Dahonzan of the Northern Hosang-zong. Kiyomizu-dera Temple, along with Kitayama Rokuen-ji
					Temple (Kinkaku-ji Temple) and Arashiyama Tenryu-ji Temple, is one of the most famous places of
					interest in Kyoto, and is crowded with pilgrims and tourists throughout the year. In addition,
					Kiyomizu-dera Temple is also ranked with temples such as Ishiyama Temple (Otsu City, Shiga
					Prefecture) and Haseji Temple (Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture), and has been known as a temple
					dedicated to Kannon since ancient times, and it is also the 16th temple among the 33 temples in the
					Western Kingdom (visiting 33 Kannon temples in the Kansai region). It has often appeared in Japanese
					literature since the Heian period. In 1994, Kiyomizu-dera Temple was registered as a World Heritage
					Site as part of the cultural property of the ancient capital of Kyoto.
