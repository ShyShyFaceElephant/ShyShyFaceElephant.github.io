				<h2>Attraction Features</h2>

					Kuromon Ichiba Market is located in the southern area of Nippombashi, near the center of Osaka city.
					Within a 580-meter arcade, there are approximately 170 shops including fishmongers, greengrocers,
					butchers, and snack shops. Known as the kitchen that supports the daily meals of Osaka residents,
					the market attracts around 30,000 visitors per day on regular days and up to 150,000 visitors during
					the year-end period. It is believed that fish trading started here as early as 1822 in the Edo
					period, and it was initially called Enmeiji Market, named after the nearby Enmeiji Temple. The
					market later came to be known as Kuromon Ichiba Market because the gate of Enmeiji Temple was black
					in color. Originally renowned as a market frequented by professional chefs, the market has seen an
					increase in general customers in recent years, with many tourists enjoying the pleasure of walking
					and eating.<br>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Trusted fishmongers selling high-quality seafood:
						It is said that fishmongers have gathered at Kuromon Ichiba Market since the Edo period to
						buy
						and
						sell fresh fish. As a market specializing in seafood, it has prospered throughout history,
						and
						thus,
						there are still many fish shops today. Eel in summer and pufferfish in winter are local
						specialties,
						with 10% of the fish shops selling pufferfish. Renowned chefs from upscale Japanese
						restaurants
						also
						come to this market to procure fresh and high-quality fish.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						paradise where you can walk and eat with the determination to eat until you drop:
						Not only for professionals but also for general customers, Kuromon Ichiba Market opens its
						doors
						wide. Various mouthwatering fresh foods are displayed at the shop entrances, and energetic
						staff
						members loudly welcome customers, saying, "Welcome!" Many shops sell their products skewered
						on
						bamboo sticks for customers to enjoy while walking, and there are also seating areas
						available
						for
						dining in.<br>
					</li>
					<li>
						tourist center that provides comprehensive services to foreign visitors:
						Opened in 2016, the "Kuromon Tourist Center" offers many delightful services to the
						increasing
						number of foreign tourists in recent years. The center has English- and Chinese-speaking
						staff
						members on duty and provides brochures in various languages. They also have currency
						exchange
						machines, so visitors can use them even if they don't have enough Japanese yen.
						Additionally,
						they
						offer services such as delivery to hotels and baggage storage. <br>
